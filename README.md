## How to Play

Guessing Letters:

- Click on the letters displayed on the screen to make a guess. The game will check if the selected letter is part of the hidden word. Correct guesses will be revealed in the word, and incorrect guesses will lead to hanging pieces to fall.

Hanging Pieces:

- With each incorrect letter guess, a piece will fall. The goal is to guess the word before all the peaces fall down.

Guessing the Whole Word:

- Alternatively, you can try to guess the entire word at once. Be cautious! An incorrect attempt to guess the entire word will cost you a life.

Lives:

- You start the game with 8 lives. Guessing the entire word incorrectly or accumulating too many incorrect letter guesses will result in losing a life.

Winning:

- Successfully guess the entire word before running out of lives to win the PANERA.
